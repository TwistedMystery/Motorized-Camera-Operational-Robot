This repository contains the documentation and code for a pick and place robot project. The goal of the project is to create a compact 4 DOF (Degree of Freedom) robot, utilizing 3D printed parts for the links, servo motors for movement, and an Arduino Uno for control.

## Project Overview

The initial design involves controlling the robot using a smaller, 3D-printed arm, where signals from its angular movement are translated into the motions of the larger robot arm. The project aims to evolve this concept by integrating inverse kinematics and polynomial regression to enable the robot's autonomous movement.

In the future, if the system is successfully implemented, machine learning techniques could be incorporated to allow the robot to handle complex materials.
